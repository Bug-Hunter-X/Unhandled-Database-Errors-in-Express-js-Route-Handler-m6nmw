# Unhandled Database Errors in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling for database operations within route handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with proper error handling.

## Bug Description

The provided Express.js route handler successfully handles the case where a user is not found (HTTP 404). However, it lacks error handling for potential database operation failures (e.g., connection errors, query errors).  If the database query fails, the application may crash or return an unexpected response.

## Solution

The solution involves using `try...catch` blocks to gracefully handle potential errors during database operations.  Error handling ensures a more robust and reliable application.
